# JSP_to_JSTl_basicConversion_UploadDownload
Very basic: Uploading a JSP and converting some tags to JSTL and downloading that file.

JSTL can be used very easily through modelandview and in this example I have tried to automate conversion of JSP to JSTL. This is very basic example. However quite large conversion would require for resources and time. Still you can try the basic and clear your facts on uploading and downloading after the conversion of files.

Note: Use only the test.jsp file for conversion. If you want some other file try automating your own code.

Thank you
Enjoy Coding.
